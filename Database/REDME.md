# Instructions for reproducing the dataset generation

Due to the size of the generated files, GitHub does not support the instantiation of all the files necessary to reproduce the processed dataset.
Therefore, we have made all the data we used available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bgu687V1C4iyD7O4rB70pFdAkBok0bEA?usp=sharing). Here are the steps to reproduce the file ```NASA_DSCOVR_Challenge_Dataset.ipynb```:

1. Download the file ```Nasa_Space_Apps_Challenge_Database.zip``` from the link provided;
2. Unzip the dataset in the same dependency as ```NASA_DSCOVR_Challenge_Dataset.ipynb```;
3. Execute the cells of the jupyter notebook.

The generated database is available on the same link provided with the name ```Database_solution.csv```.
